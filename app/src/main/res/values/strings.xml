        <item>Dinner guests dont have to know how simple this crockpot roast is to make. Simmer pork with cranberry sauce and spices, then serve with tart apples for a delicious medley of textures.</item>
        <item>What sets this fried chicken apart from the typical recipe is that milk is added after partially cooking the chicken so the pieces simmer rather than fry.</item>
        <item>Using frozen artichokes in this Italian-style chicken dish makes assembling the casserole recipe convenient because the inedible parts of the vegetable are removed.</item>
        <item>Meaty chicken pieces simmer with dried fruit in a spiced wine mixture for a richly flavored winter dish.</item>

        <item>Nuts and cranberries fill these simple baked apples that cook in your slow-cooker. Top them with Sea Salt Caramel Sauce and, if you like, a scoop of vanilla ice cream. </item>
